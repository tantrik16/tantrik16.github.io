## Abstract
A program run, in the setting of computer architecture and compilers, can be
characterized in part by its memory access patterns. We approach the problem of
analyzing these patterns using machine learning. We characterize memory accesses
using a sequence of cache miss rates, and present a new data set for this task.
The data set draws from programs run on various Java virtual machines, and C
and Fortran compilers. We work towards answering the scientific question: How
predictable is a programâ€™s cache miss rate from interval to interval as it executes?
We report the results of three distinct ANN models, which have been shown to be
effective in sequence modeling. We show that programs can be differentiated in
terms of the predictability of their cache miss rates.
